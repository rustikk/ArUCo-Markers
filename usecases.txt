April tags and ArUCo markers are 2D binary patterns that computer vision algorithms can easily detect.

Typically, ArUCo markers and April tags are used for:

camera calibration
object size estimation
measuring the distance between camera and object
3D position
object orientation
robotics and autonomous navigation

Benefits of using ArUCo over April tags:

ArUCo markers are built into the opencv library via the cv2.aruco submodule

The openCV library can generate ArUCo markers via the cv2.aruco.drawMaker function

There are online ArUCo generators whereas April tags have no easily findable online generators

There are ROS (Robot Operating System) implementations of ArUCo markers

From an implementation perspective, ArUco marker detections tend to be more accurate, even when using the default parameters
